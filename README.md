# LaBiblioteca

Mapping projection of a writing input system. Made with Processing, Java.

# Technologies

Developed using:
- Java Language
- Processing 3.5.4
- Keystone Mapping Library (David Bouchard)
- Video Library for Processing 3 (The Processing Foundation)

# Idea and development

This interactive experience is designed for individual use in multiple iterations. 
Each interacting user types on a keyboard and receives visual feedback on the mapped surface of a book. 
The book simulates to be burning and the user interaction allows you to reverse it.
At the end, the system makes a copy of what was written and restarts to receive the next user.

# Implementation

The mapping library was implemented to perform a projection on the surface of a book.
Users receive visual feedback from their interaction on the book as if it were a screen.

The Video Library has been implemented to play a video of flames on the surface of the book, simulating that the surface is burning.
The video advances or rewinds its playback depending on the user's interaction.
